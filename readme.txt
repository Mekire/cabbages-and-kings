This project represents an effort to completely recode one of my earliest projects. The original project ran perfectly fine, but as it grew it became more and more unmaintainable. This eventually led to it being abandoned. My primary goal is to rewrite the program as is while resisting the urge to add any features. After this is complete I hope to refine some of the graphics.
